In my e-commerce project, I developed a comprehensive website that encompasses essential features required for a successful online shopping experience. This includes user registration and authentication, product listing and search functionality, shopping cart management, order processing, and payment integration.

To ensure a secure and seamless user experience, I implemented various integrations such as mail OTP verification, enabling users to verify their accounts and securely access the platform. Additionally, I integrated popular payment gateways like PayPal, allowing customers to make secure and convenient online payments.

The website also includes features like order tracking functionalities to enhance user satisfaction. Responsive design and intuitive user interfaces were implemented to optimize the website for different devices and provide a smooth browsing experience.

Overall, my e-commerce project encompasses a wide range of features required for a successful online store, providing users with a secure, efficient, and enjoyable shopping experience.
